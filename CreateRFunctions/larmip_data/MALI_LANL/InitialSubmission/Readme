This archive contains the results of LARMIP run by MALI (Mpas-Albany Land Ice model) using an uniform 20km mesh, inluding:
1) 6 text files of 200 yr sea-level rise contribution from 5 sub-regions (defined by LARMIP) and 1 ctrl run. The unit is m.
2) 1 figures (larmip_lanl_mali.png) plotting 6 curves in these 6 text files
3) 5 figures that show the uniform additional basal melt rates for 5 sub-regions on top of Rignot's background basal melt map. The units are kg m^{-2} s^{-1}

A description of MALI can be found at https://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/gmd-2018-78/. The code is available at https://github.com/MPAS-Dev/MPAS-Model

The results are run by Tong Zhang on May 4th, 2018, with the assitance of Matthew Hoffman, Stephen Price and Mauro Perego
